This project is a learning playground for exploring different SwiftUI techniques and design patterns. 
It isn’t intended to be the most feature-rich or production-ready todo application—rather, it’s an experimental sandbox where I implement new ideas and mechanics as they occur to me, without worrying about covering every possible use case.
